            <h1>solitary motion, in the wake of an avalanche</h1>

            <h2>deer in the headlights, there<br>
                goes a weaker one</h2>

            <p>he's listenin' in the fast gaze, i don't care now to see the way<br>
                do you hear the silence? i was far too late</p>

            <p>oh living for the city, and it's always troubling<br>
                to keep it in the hot lane, i don't care about no scenery<br>
                and you run from it then, now you can't escape, cause it's all you see</p>
